# General Instructions

1. We use ' for strings if practical, and """ for docstrings.
2. Dependencies are stored in requirements.txt and installed using `pip --install -r requirements.txt`
3. Always test code changes to verify that the code works as expected.
4. The `./src` directory is a part of the `PYTHONPATH` and should not be part of an import statement.
   If the import fails, check to see if `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly or not.
